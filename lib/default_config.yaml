# Many FLAC torrents on Redacted marked as 16-bit are actually 24-bit, mostly
# coming from Bandcamp, which does not make a distinction on their download
# page. If this setting is set to true, redacted_better will attempt to modify
# the torrent, and get another regular FLAC upload at the same time. This will
# only occur on torrents which you have permission to edit. Users belonging to
# the Elite class or higher have edit permissions for all torrents. Otherwise,
# you are only allowed to edit torrents you have uploaded yourself. Accepted
# values are "true" or "false".
